----------
FURTHER INFO:
DevHealth will be getting a major update for PM5+ Shortly! 
But it is recommended you stick to the stable releases here!
Pocketmine 5 is not out yet, only alpha versions therefore any updates for pm5 will remain unstable until the Proper PM5 comes out and plugins can recieve a stable update!
